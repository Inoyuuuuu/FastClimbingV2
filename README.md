### Credits
Thanks to [FlipMods](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FlipMods/) for allowing me to implement some of his code (config syncing) from [BetterStamina](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FlipMods/BetterStamina/)!

## 
This simple mod was intended to be an addition to my other mod **“GiantExtensionLadders”**. They work well together, but I decided to split them into two different mods so that their features can be used separately.
